Evolution is an evolution simulator of a colony of little blue dots. Each blue dot has it's own genome comprised of 6 different traits that get passed down and mutated. Overtime through sexual selection the population will see an overall increase in traits as well as reach a fairly steady population that can be supported by the plant growth.
This project was written as my first larger project and also featured my first attempt at graphics in a project. The project featured a web server to allow for anyone to check on the progress of the current simulation (which has since been taken down), a basic web interface and a python backend.
